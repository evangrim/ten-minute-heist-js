	<h1 style="text-align: center;">About 10 Minute Heist</h1>
	<div style="max-width: 36em; margin: 0 auto;">
	<p>10 Minute Heist is a fun, fast-playing tabletop card game designed by my friend <a href="http://www.sibicky.com/">Nick Sibicky</a> and published by our pals at <a href="https://www.dailymagicgames.com/">Daily Magic Games</a>. In 10 Minute Heist, players are thieves looting a wizard's tower of magical artifacts. Players take turns selecting a card to move from the 'Tower' to their personal 'Haul.' The rules are simple:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A player can take a card from their row or lower, but not from a higher row. If there is no legal selection available, the player must exit the tower.</li>
		<li>After taking a card, do what the card says at the bottom.</li>
		<li>When all players have exited the tower, the game is scored based on several categories, with points for each category being awarded to the player with the highest total in that category:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Suits: </strong>For each suit, players add up values showing on matching cards (some cards count toward multiple suits).</li>
				<li><strong>Numbers: </strong>For each number, players count the number of their cards showing that value (some cards count toward multiple numbers).</li>
				<li><strong>Curses: </strong>Curse awards lower a player's score. Players count the curses on their cards. There are different awards for players with the most, second-most and fewest curses.</li>
				<li><strong>Exit order: </strong>Players get points based on the order they exit the tower. Earlier is better.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I chose to implement this game as a javascript program because the core rules are very simple, yet there are plenty of challenges to taken on as long as I am interested.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The next step after finishing the basic play and scoring is to implement card-specific effects. I could write a special function for each card, or for an additional challenge, I can abstract a system of tokens, with card being represented by a sequence of tokens that are parsed into particular functionality.</li>
	<li>As a card game laid out in a rectangular grid, it's a great opportunity to dive into CSS Grid. Again, implementing a more responsive solution respresents an opportunity for additional challenge.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I recommend giving the game a try. It's fast, fun, cheap, and easy to teach.
